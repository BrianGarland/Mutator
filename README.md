# Mutator
A tool to help you find code changes required because of expanding database columns.

This is a work in progress and will be broken up into multiple phases
1. Files to store the data and command to find files, programs, and fields used.
2. More files and command to allow the user to define a "mutation".
3. Search program to take all that info and find the needed changes.
4. Allow user to choose which changes will be made and kick off the "mutation".
